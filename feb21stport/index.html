    Stuff about Michael.
  </h2>
<p>
  First off my name is Michael Arvizu welcome to my portfolio. here's a little information about me.
  when i was growing up i was so into video games. so then i told my mom that i wanted to be game designer when i grow up,
  she said,"follow your dreams son." so from there on i got more into games. once i hit age 14 i was transfered to continuation school
  for bad kids. so then i noticed that youtube was blocked on the computers at the school, so i decided to try and remove the block.
  surprisingly it was success. i dont recall what i did exactly cuz it was like 2 years ago however, once i seen that i wanted to learn more about computers.
  not coding exactly tho, more like working with computers and basically doing things to them that other people cant do. from there on
  i kept unblocking sites for kids at the school. no teacher or staff noticed who was doing it. so after i got dropped from that school i couldnt really
  focus on computers that much i dont know why but, i decided to go into photography. that is my current hobbie, along working with computers.
